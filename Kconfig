config ZMK_CDC_ACM_BOOTLOADER_TRIGGER
    bool "Enter bootloader mode when CDC ACM port is closed after being opened at 1200bps"
    depends on USB_CDC_ACM && USB_DEVICE_STACK
    help
      When enabled, the device will reset into bootloader mode
      when a CDC ACM port with the bootloader-trigger property is closed after being opened at 1200bps.
      This is compatible with the Arduino bootloader trigger mechanism.

    int "Milliseconds to delay before jumping to bootloader"
    default 100
    help
      Time to wait after detecting port close before jumping to bootloader.
      This allows USB communications to complete.

config ZMK_CDC_ACM_BOOTLOADER_TRIGGER_POLL_MS
    int "Milliseconds between polling CDC ACM state"
    default 100
    help
      Interval in milliseconds to poll the CDC ACM state to detect 
      when the port is opened at 1200 baud and then closed.
      Polling only occurs when USB is connected.

config ZMK_CDC_ACM_BOOTLOADER_TRIGGER_RESET_CODE
    hex "Reset code for entering bootloader mode"
    default 0x57
    help
      The reset code to use when rebooting into bootloader mode.
      Default value 0x57 is for UF2 bootloader (used on Adafruit nRF52 Bootloader).
      For other boards/bootloaders, you may need to use a different code.
